# `Node`: a sparse 32-slot map

The workhorse of the trie. `positionsMask` records which of the 32 slots are present;
`elements` stores only the present children, compactly, in ascending slot order. The
array index of slot `i` is `arrayIndex positionsMask i` (popcount of the mask below
`i`), the standard HAMT trick.

These operations are generic in the child type `α`. The lattice operations
(`join`/`meet`/`restricts`) are driven by the masks so that children present on only
one side are reused (`join`) or dropped (`meet`) without inspecting them; the
`combine`/`rel` callbacks decide what happens on slots present in both. `combine`
returns `Option` so an empty intersection can prune a slot.

No `Inhabited α` is required: reads go through `xs[i]?`, and `set!`/`insertIdx!`/
`eraseIdx!` are total on `Array`.

/-- A sparse array of up to 32 children, addressed by a 5-bit slot index.

The `elements_compact` field is the structural invariant from `docs/DESIGN.md`: the
elements array holds *exactly* the present children, so its size equals the number of set
bits in `positionsMask`. Every `Node` value carries this proof, so it holds by
construction everywhere a node appears — and the operations below each re-establish it. -/
structure Node (α : Type u) where
  positionsMask : UInt32
  elements : Array α
  elements_compact : elements.size = popCount positionsMask

/-- Structural equality on the data fields (the `elements_compact` proof is irrelevant). -/
instance {α : Type u} [BEq α] : BEq (Node α) where
  beq a b := a.positionsMask == b.positionsMask && a.elements == b.elements

/-- The structural `BEq` decides propositional equality: it compares the two data fields
with their own (lawful) `BEq`s, and the proof field is equal by proof irrelevance. Needed so
that maps — whose leaves are `Node α` — inherit `LawfulBEq`. -/
instance {α : Type u} [BEq α] [LawfulBEq α] : LawfulBEq (Node α) where

/-- The value-level reading of `restricts` at a single slot/key: present on the left forces
present on the right with `rel` holding; absent on the left is vacuously fine. This is the
denotational counterpart of `restricts` the way `optVmeet` is for `meet`. Lives here (not in
`PTree`) because `Node.restricts_iff` already needs it. -/

/-- Value-level union of two lookups: a key survives if present on *either* side. Values present
on both are combined with `c`; a value present on one side is copied. The total-`combine` companion
of `Node.optJoin` (`combine x y = some (c x y)`), used at the leaf/tree/collection levels. -/

/-- A leaf collection: maps 5-bit slot indices to values of type `V`. This is the single

The two reductions of `get?`'s dependent `if`, plus the merge accumulator's reading. Nearly

These support the "no empty leaf" side of the canonical-shape invariant (`PTree.WF`). The mask
helpers record how `insert`/`alter` move `positionsMask`; the emptiness facts they feed
(`isEmpty_insert`, `isEmpty_alter_invariant`, `eq_empty_of_isEmpty`) discharge the map leaf's
`LeafOps.insert_ne_empty`/`isEmpty_modify`/`eq_empty_of_isEmpty` obligations. -/

/-! ### `get?` characterization and node extensionality

These support the `get?`-based denotational semantics the `NatCollection` lattice laws
(associativity, …) are proved against. `get?_join` reads off a `join` result slot-by-slot as a
value-level merge `optJoin`; `Node.ext` recovers a node from its `get?`. Slot indices are always
`< 32` here (they come from 5-bit `chunk`s), matching `UInt32`'s mod-32 shift semantics. -/

a slot survives only if present on *both* sides (and the `combine` does not prune it). `get?_meet`
reads off a `meet` result slot-by-slot via the same `get?_mergeLoop` invariant. Commutativity of
both operations then falls out of `Node.ext` + `get?_join`/`get?_meet`. -/
